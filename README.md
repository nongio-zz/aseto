.ase to something converter

usage:

./aseparse.rb -i ~/Desktop/colors.ase -f html -o index.html

Actually the ase parser does not support LAB mode colors, so you must export the swatches palette in the right format. Create a document on Photoshop and ensure that the color mode is set to RGB then from the swatches panel press save Swatches for Exchange...
